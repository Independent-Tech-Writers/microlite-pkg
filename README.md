# microlite... Now a package!
microlite is an Ã¼ber-small (3.3kb) lightbox that leaves a microscopic footprint. It was originally 
[built by @danklammer](https://github.com/danklammer/microlite). I'll make sure this repo (for packaging) maintains feature 
parity with that original repo.

## Purpose

microlite is a JavaScript lightbox with zero dependencies. It has no extras, no icons, no options and no bloat, but looks 
nice and is easy to use. If you want special behavior, extra options or flexible features, you'll need to consider another 
lightbox library (or fork this one and edit it yourself!).

microlite only modifies and animates composite (transform and opacity) CSS properties, giving you buttery smooth 60 FPS 
transitions. And it uses CSS multiple backgrounds to load in the high-res version on top of the low-res, making the 
experience fast and seamless. Plus, including it in your app is as easy as `import`ing and setting an `onclick={}`.


## Installation

**NPM:**
```
npm install microlite --save
```

## Usage

**React:**
Using microlite is easy: just add the microlite function to the `onclick` event on an `<a>` tag, with the thumbnail 
inside it, like this:

```js
/* Import microlite */
import microLite from 'microlite';

class YourLightboxImage extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return (
      <a href='[full-image.jpg]'  onClick={(e) => microLite(e)}>
        <img src='[thumbnail-image.jpg]' />
      </a>
    );
  }
}
```

...You can also use it without Babel/ES6 syntax:

```js
return (
  <a href='[full-image.jpg]'  onClick={function(e) { microLite(e) }}>
    <img src='[thumbnail-image.jpg]' />
  </a>
);
```
